Assignment:


You are the lead programmer for a small chain of supermarkets. You are required to make a simple
cashier function that adds products to a cart and displays the total price.


You have the following test products registered:


 Product code                    Name                                                     Price

 GR1                             Green tea                                               £3.11


 SR1                             Strawberries                                            £5.00

 CF1                             Coffee                                                 £11.23



Special conditions:

    ●   The CEO is a big fan of buy-one-get-one-free offers and of green tea. He wants us to add a

        rule to do this.

    ●   The COO, though, likes low prices and wants people buying strawberries to get a price

        discount for bulk purchases. If you buy 3 or more strawberries, the price should drop to £4.50

    ●   The CTO is a coffee addict. If you buy 3 or more coffees, the price of all coffees should drop

        to two thirds of the original price.

Our check-out can scan items in any order, and because the CEO and COO change their minds

often, it needs to be flexible regarding our pricing rules.

The interface to our checkout looks like this (shown in ruby):
  co = Checkout.new(pricing_rules)
  co.scan(item)

  co.scan(item)
  price = co.total


Implement a checkout system that fulfills these requirements.
